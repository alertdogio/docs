## Webhook Message Format

AlertDog will send JSON formatted data to your Webhook URL via POST method:

```json
{
  "event": "monitor_triggered",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "monitor": {
    "id": "monitor_123",
    "name": "BTC Address Monitoring",
    "type": "wallet"
  },
  "data": {
    // Monitoring related data
  }
}
```

## Security Configuration

<Warning>
  It is recommended to enable signature verification to ensure that received requests come from AlertDog. You can set a unique character when configuring the URI.
</Warning>

Usage Instructions: After configuration, when monitoring is triggered, AlertDog will send a request to your Webhook URL. You can process these requests in your own application to implement custom notification logic.
