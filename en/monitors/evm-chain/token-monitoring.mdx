## Add Token Monitoring

Token monitoring supports two main monitoring types: TOP holder change monitoring and large transaction monitoring.

### TOP Holder Change Monitoring

TOP holder change monitoring helps you grasp whale holding changes in real-time, gaining early insights into market trends and fund flows.

**Example**: Monitor operations greater than $10,000 by the TOP 20 holders of token "Binance Life"

### Large Transaction Monitoring

Large transaction monitoring can capture large transfer activities, quickly discovering potential pump or dump signals.

**Example**: Monitor transactions greater than $1 million for token "Binance Life"

<Tip>
  Properly setting monitoring thresholds can help you filter out unimportant transactions and focus on truly valuable whale behavior and large transactions.
