<Info>
  EVM chains refer to blockchain networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that can run Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

## What is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a core component of the Ethereum network, a decentralized computing environment used to execute smart contract code.

### Core Features of EVM

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Turing Complete" icon="gear">
    EVM is Turing complete, meaning it can execute any algorithm or computational task as long as there is sufficient Gas fee support. This enables developers to create complex decentralized applications.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deterministic Execution" icon="check">
  The same input in EVM always produces the same output, ensuring consistent smart contract execution results across all nodes, maintaining network consensus.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Isolated Environment" icon="shield">
  Smart contracts run in EVM's sandboxed environment, isolated from the host system, ensuring security and preventing malicious code from affecting the network.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gas Mechanism" icon="gas-pump">
    Limits computational resource usage through the Gas mechanism, preventing infinite loops and resource abuse, ensuring stable network operation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer directly between EVM chains?">
    No, direct transfers are not possible. You need to use bridge services to transfer assets between different EVM chains.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is it safe to use the same wallet address on EVM chains?">
  Yes, you can use the same wallet address (such as MetaMask address) on all EVM chains. However, it's recommended to use different wallet addresses for different purposes to improve security of fund management.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to add EVM chains to wallet?">
  In wallets like MetaMask, go to "Settings" → "Networks" → "Add Network", fill in the target EVM chain's RPC URL, chain ID, block explorer URL and other information. Most major EVM chains provide one-click add functionality.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the Gas tokens for different EVM chains?">
    Each EVM chain has its own native token for paying Gas fees:
    
    - Ethereum: ETH
    - BNB Chain: BNB
    - Polygon: MATIC
    - Arbitrum: ETH
    - Optimism: ETH
    - Base: ETH
