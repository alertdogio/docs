## Add Multi-Address Monitoring

Multi-address monitoring helps you discover tokens that multiple wallets operate on in coordination within a short time period, which is usually an important market signal.

### Configuration Example

Monitor 47 wallets where 3 wallets buy the same token within 5 minutes, and all buy amounts exceed $100, and the token's market cap is greater than 200k.
