You can effectively filter spam token airdrop notifications through the following four methods:

### Method 1: Add Filter Conditions

When adding address monitoring, click "Add Filter Condition".

    alt="Address monitoring configuration page showing add filter condition button"
  />
</Frame>

Set USD amount >= $100.

  <img
    src="/images/faq/amount-filter-setting.png"
    alt="Filter condition setting, USD amount greater than or equal to $100"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  This method only notifies transactions exceeding $100, which can effectively filter spam token airdrop notifications; may not filter honeypot token notifications, transactions below $100 cannot be received
</Tip>


### Method 2: Select Only Spend and Swap for Monitoring Behavior

When adding address monitoring, select only Spend and Swap for monitoring behavior.

    alt="Address monitoring configuration, only selecting spend and swap behaviors"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  This method only notifies spend/buy/sell transactions, which can effectively filter all spam token airdrop notifications; other "receive" behavior transactions also cannot be received
</Tip>


### Method 3: Manually Add Tokens to Blacklist

In personal settings, find EVM Token Blacklist and manually add addresses of spam tokens you want to filter.

    alt="User settings page showing EVM token blacklist option"
  />
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Add Blacklist Token">

    alt="Interface for adding tokens to blacklist"
  />
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Blacklist Addition Successful">
  <img
    src="/images/faq/blacklist-token-added.png"
    alt="Token successfully added to blacklist"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Tokens added to the EVM token blacklist will not trigger notifications
</Tip>
