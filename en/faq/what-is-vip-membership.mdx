title: "Pro Permissions Not Activated After Purchase"
description: "Purchased Pro and payment was successful, but permissions are not activated?"

It may be one of the following two situations, please troubleshoot one by one
 




### Situation 1: Payment wallet differs from login wallet, need to switch wallets to confirm
**Example:**

You logged in with Wallet A and purchased Pro service

But actually paid with Wallet B

→ Result: Pro permissions are bound to Wallet A, Wallet B has no permissions.

**Solution:**

Confirm the wallet address you were logged in with when purchasing;

Switch back to that wallet to log in;

Re-enter the system to restore Pro permissions.



### Situation 2: Transaction pending for extended period, need manual order completion

**Example:**

Some on-chain transactions may be stuck in "pending confirmation" status for an extended period due to network congestion or low Gas, and Pro permissions are not received.

**Solution:**

Click the "Manual Order Completion" button on the purchase page, select

  </Frame>

Enter the transaction Hash and confirm order completion, wait for the system to re-check the order status and grant permissions.
